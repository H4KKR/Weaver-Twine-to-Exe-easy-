There are a few similar projects on the internet that allow you to convert Twine projects to .exe files, but none as simple as this. All are like their own 'DIY' project for you to complete. If you're a Twine developer and not a back-end developer with knowledge of Electron or iexpress, this project is for you. To cut the hassle of setup, I encourage you to buy the exe. If you don't mind the work of installing dependancies, then get cracking with the setup below!
